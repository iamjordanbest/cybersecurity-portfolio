### Key Observations:
- Initial improvement trend established
- Current state shows realistic compliance level
- Velocity indicates need for focused improvement initiatives
- Some control families performing below average

---

## 🎯 Control Family Performance

### Top Performers:
- Families with >80% compliance
- Showing improvement trends
- Well-documented and tested

### Needs Attention:
